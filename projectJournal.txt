Author: Matthew Waters

Week 19/10/2020
	What I am doing this week:
		I setup the examples for ML-agents in Unity locally to try and get a 
		better understanding on how the machine learning works in Unity.
		I also started putting together my proposal and finalising my architectural diagram.
	What I found tough:
		This week was just mainly research so there was no challenges.


Week 26/10/2020
	What I am doing this week:
		This week I will be focusing on finishing my architectural diagram and project propsal.
		If i get this done I will start looking into test code that comes with the ML-agents plugin.
	What i found tough:
		There was no major challenges this week as I was putting together my propsal.
		
Week 9/11/2020 and Week 16/11/2020
	What I did: 
		Finished my basic movement of a character with simple code to aid easier AI learning.
	What I am working on:
		I am now working on the tag funciontality where the character touches off another character
		it counts as a tag instead of a user input to count as a tag.
		
Week 23/11/2020
	What I did:
		Finished up the tag functionality to where a player touches a specfic player it counts as a tag
	What I am working on:
		I am going to lay out a small arena to try and implement AI, but first i will code in that when a character is tagged it will
			respawn in a random location inside the arean. This will aid in training the AI to tag other players and "go towards" the person
			it wants to tag.
